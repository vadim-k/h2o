Mason 8.x-1.0-dev, 2016-03-28
-----------------------------
- #2690959 by Nikhilesh Gupta: Deprecated Method.
- Lazyload CSS background by default as it is now dependent on Blazy to avoid
  too many http requests with so many mason boxes, useful for mason below the
  fold, meaning Mason is optimized by default now.
- Dropped supporting possible multi-lazyloader, since existing solutions do not
  support lazyloading CSS background image like Blazy.
- Added entity_keys status to disable Default optionset later.
- Moved CSS background image from the .box into .box__content to allow
  hiding lazyloaded content until loaded.
- #2693347: Add dependency on Blazy.
  Be sure to clear cache to get the new services in place.
